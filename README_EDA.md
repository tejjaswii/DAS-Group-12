# Exploratory Data Analysis Branch

## Overview
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) branch hosts scripts and notebooks that provide an initial look at the data, using various statistical and visualization techniques to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.

## Activities
- Visualizing the distribution of individual variables.
- Exploring the relationships between different variables.
- Identifying patterns that might warrant further analysis or inform model selection.

## Scripts and Notebooks
- `Exploratory_Analysis.qmd`: Contains code for performing initial statistical testing and generating various graphs and charts to explore data.

## How to Use
To conduct EDA, run the scripts provided, which will generate outputs in the form of graphs and tables.

## Contribution
Insights from EDA can be highly valuable. If you have conducted additional analysis or created informative visualizations, please share them by submitting a pull request to this branch.
