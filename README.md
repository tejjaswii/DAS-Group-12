# Formal Analysis Branch

## Overview
This branch contains the work related to the formal statistical analysis of the cleaned coffee quality data. Here, we use Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess the impact of various factors on the quality classification of coffee.

## Analysis Performed
- Building and evaluating GLM models.
- Estimating the influence of each factor on coffee quality.
- Performing model diagnostics and validation.

## Scripts
- `GLM_Project2.qmd`: The script for conducting GLM analysis on the cleaned data.

## Results
The results folder contains:
- Model summaries and coefficients.
- Diagnostic plots to assess model fit.
- Validation metrics and interpretation.

## How to Use
Execute the `glm_analysis.R` script to replicate the analysis. Make sure to adjust any file paths as needed.

## Contribution
To contribute to the formal analysis, please ensure that suggestions or changes are backed by statistical reasoning. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation of your proposed changes.
